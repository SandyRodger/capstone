# 3 tier architecture

## ChatGPT:
- What 3-Tier Architecture Is
  - A software architecture pattern that splits an application into three logical layers:
    - Presentation layer (UI) – what the user sees and interacts with (web app, mobile app, etc.).
    - Application / business logic layer – the “brains” that process requests, enforce rules, and make decisions.
    - Data layer – databases or data storage where information is saved and retrieved.
- Why It’s Used
  - Separation of concerns: each layer has a distinct responsibility.
  - Scalability: you can scale layers independently (e.g., add more app servers without touching the database).
  - Maintainability: easier to update or swap out one layer without breaking everything.
  - Security: the database isn’t exposed directly to users.
- Typical Real-World Setup
  - Presentation layer → Browser or mobile app. Could be HTML/CSS/JS or a React frontend.
  - Application layer → A backend service (Node.js, Java Spring, Ruby on Rails, etc.) that processes logic.
  - Data layer → SQL/NoSQL database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.).
- Example request flow:
  - User clicks "Buy" → Frontend sends request → Backend checks stock, updates DB → Response sent back to frontend → User sees confirmation.
- Likely Topics You’ll Learn Today
  - How data flows between tiers (request/response cycle).
  - Examples of implementation in web systems.
  - Advantages & disadvantages vs. other architectures (e.g., monoliths, 2-tier, microservices).
  - Where it shows up in modern systems (almost everywhere — from small apps to enterprise setups).
