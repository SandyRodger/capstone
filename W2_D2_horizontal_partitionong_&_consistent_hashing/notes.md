- Database performance:
  - it's not the same as scaling.
  - Improve performance means you can delay scaling
  - Performance is where problems occur.
  - Good performance can be different numbers of ms depending on what users expect and what the system is doing
    - Amazon shoppers expect snappiness
    - paying does not have expectation of high speed.
  - But you can say anything 500ms< is good 200ms< is great
  - Improve performance # 1 with indexes. The downside is the extra space & maintanance.
