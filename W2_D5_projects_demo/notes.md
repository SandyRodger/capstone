### System design interview recap

- Rodney's talk shows that even this real company has a solution to their problemm, that doesn't perfectly fit the problem. It doesn't go out at 5pm for each user. This is how SD interviews will go. It's a conversation which takes compromises into account.
- So it's not like a Leet code interview, which you can either solve or not. You can talk your way around problems vaguely and have interesting discussions based on half-remembered things from lessons.
- Final system design cheat-sheet
  - design different companys
- the expectatons for SD interviews are lower than you think. Lower than the YT videos showing perfect answers.
- The resources covered here are for the job-hunt portion, not now. And only if you need them. So just if you have a sd interview in a few days.
- Students like to stay in the learning space, because it's a safe space. You don't have to get a job. So don't fall into this temptation. Reviewing should be 20%, 80-% just applying. You want to get those interviews.

### Homework

- 30 mins reading.
- Set up a new AWS account.
- The trick to setting up a new address is to write abmrodger+capstone@gmail.com and it will go to your address, but be treated as a new address. You can do this many times.
- The homework is light, so this week end fill in gaps.
  - review System design.
  - Review things from prep.
  - You really need Python for AI week.
  - You really need React for React week.
    - especially those 2 apps
  - or rest -> fuck

- Next week:
  - make your VPC in US-East-1 (AWS account?)
