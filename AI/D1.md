- yes it's just an API call.
- BUT behind this there are a lot of software engineering challenges, which we wil look at this week.
- at the end of the week it'll be more like this:

- We're using OpenAI, no frameworks. Most big Ai APIs are similar.
- Homework is for learning, lecture is for discussing. Conversations will be guided by wherever the questions go.
- So come to class with questions.
- Office hours at 1pm Pacific (9pm English) Open to groups, pop in.
- Wednesday -> Explaining LSbot Q&A 9pm English (same zoom)

Auto-regressive: what comes next
masked language models: what comes after?
- supervised v non-supervised: type of data labelled by a human or automated = TRAINING
- Labelled data is gold-standard, but it costs a lot! So you might label 10% to jump start and the rest will be automated.
- The purpose of training is to generate/tune the parameters of your models.
- The people designing the model choose how many paramers they want.
- Supervised/unsupervised is about cost-effectivness.
